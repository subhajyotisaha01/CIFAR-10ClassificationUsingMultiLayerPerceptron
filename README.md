# CIFAR-10ClassificationUsingMultiLayerPerceptron
 ### CIFAR-10 Classification Using Multi Layer Perceptron (CS776A, IITK Course Project) <br/>
 Augmented the CIFAR-10 dataset by applying random rotation, random cutout, random cropping and horizontal or vertical flipping. <br/>
Trained a multi-layer perceptron model on augmented & non-augmented CIFAR-10 data for classification. <br/>
The implementation of feed-forward and backpropagation step was done without the use of in-built functions. <br/>
